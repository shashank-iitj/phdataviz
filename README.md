# ProducthuntDataViz

## Getting Started

I have added a small javascript library Papa Parse which to help parse the data which was stored in the csv file.


## Summary
This visualization is based on collecting data from Producthunt API from last year. The primary idea is to showcase the 
subtle difference which happens if you launch a product on weekend vs weekdays.
 
## Design
I am using bar chart to showcase the difference in launches on different days. Also, to delight 
the user I have plotted the products launched from different geographies on a map.

TODO add more info


## Feedback
include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization


## Data Files
Data File is in src/data directory name "ph_products.csv"
