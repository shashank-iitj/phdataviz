Producthunt is one of the go to places for startups, entrepreneurs and indie developers who want to showcase the product 
which they have built or to checkout what's happening in the history.

I myself have been submitted twp products on Producthunt, both of which happened to in top two product of the day.
We got really good amount of early user and PR thanks to proudcthunt. Apart from having a great product, taking care of 
few other factors can make a product launch of producthunt really successful. I explored that in Exploratory Data Analysis 
lesson as a part of this Nanadegree.

Following up on that I wanted to build a visualization where one could explore the geographical and quantitative trends
of products launched. Building this I noticed a really good insight about the difference in product launched on weekdays
vs weekends.

Hope you guys see that in the visualization.
